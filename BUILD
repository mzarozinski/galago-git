Building Galago

Java Requirements:
    Java JDK 1.5.0 or later (http://java.sun.com)

    In order to install the drmaa dependency run the scipt:
    ./scripts/installlib.sh

    Type 'mvn package' at the command line to build the projects.  The build process will run all the unit tests.  If you prefer to work from an IDE, Eclipse and NetBeans have Maven plugins.

    If you feel like skipping the tests, add in '-DskipTests' to any mvn command.

    To run the application on Unix:
      ./core/target/appassembler/bin/galago
